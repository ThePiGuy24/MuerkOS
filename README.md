# MuerkOS
A terrible OS for the Minecraft mod: Open Computers.  
Maybe it won't be terrible one day.  
It is currently in version Alpha 0003  
## Installation  
To install, copy the contents of the `source` directory onto a disk so that `init.lua` is in the root directory of the disk.  
## What it does  
Not much currently  
It't slowly getting closer to something that actually resembles an OS, that's all I can say.
