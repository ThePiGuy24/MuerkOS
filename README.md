# MuerkOS
A terrible OS for the Minecraft mod: Open Computers.  
Maybe it won't be terrible one day.  
To install, copy the contents of the `source` directory onto a disk so that `init.lua` is in the root directory of the disk.  
## What it does:  
Literally just tells you how long it took to boot up, and what drive it booted from, I know, amazing...
